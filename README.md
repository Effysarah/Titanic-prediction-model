# Titanic-prediction-model

## Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. 
The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, providing features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. 
Predicting survival is a classic problem in data science and serves as an introduction to binary classification.

## Features:

- Dataset: The model is trained on the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information like age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

- Model Architecture: The Titanic prediction model is built using Scikit-learn. It employs Random Fores and Logistic Regression for binary classification.

- Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using standard binary classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  
  The model will predict whether the passenger in the given example would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## Evaluation:

The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

- Accuracy: logistic regression >> 78%
            random forest >> 80%
- Precision: logistic regression >> 0.78 respectively
             random forest >> 0.80, 0.79
- Recall: logistic regression >> 0.86
            random forest >> 0.86, 0.72
- F1 Score: logistic regression >> 0.82
            random forest >> 0.83, 0.75
